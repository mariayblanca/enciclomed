 -for everyday activities such as going to the bathroom or eating

12
02:27:00.000 --> 02:46:00.000

 -you listen to him but you are not able to answer

13 
02:47:00.000 --> 02:58:00.000
-and finally death since this disease makes your body stop working and
-forget how it works

14
02:59:00.000 --> 03:07:00.000
